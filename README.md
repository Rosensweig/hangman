## Installation and running instructions

* Note: you can skip installation instructions entirely, if you prefer to view the [live](https://dry-mesa-71416.herokuapp.com) version on Heroku.
  + Project is viewable online from your mobile device, but requires a Linux/Mac/Windows computer to run locally. 
* Make sure you have Node installed on your machine
  + To check, run from the command line: `node -v`
  + If you don't have Node installed, install it with your favorite package manager: try `brew install node`, or your preference
  + If you don't have any compatible package managers, click for [Linux](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux), [Mac](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac), or [Windows](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) instructions.
* From the command line, in the project's home directory, run the following commands:
  + `npm install`
  + `npm install --prefix client`
  + `npm run build --prefix client`
* Dependencies are now installed. If you return to this project later, you can start from this point to run it.
* To start the server, run `npm start`
  + View the project from a web browser, at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* To stop your server when done, hit `ctrl-c` from the same command line window.
